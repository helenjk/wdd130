            <p class="p1_river1">** Peixe River **</p>
            <p class="p2_river1">Our rafting on the Rio do Peixe has two routes, the family rafting (4km) and the adventure
                     rafting (7km). The activity strictly follows international protocols and everything is 
                     done very safely, without losing the main meaning that is fun. 
                     The 4km rafting is carried out throughout the year and the 7km rafting depends on the river 
                     level and the volume of rainfall for it to occur.</p>

            <p class="p1_river2">** Contas River **</p>
            <p class="p2_river2">The Contas river rises in the Chapada Diamatina area and runs 620 km until it flows into Concha beach, 
                    in Itacaré (BA). It has rapids from level III to IV and through a small canyon. 
                    The guides also usually stop at places where you can jump off rocks to dive into the river. </p>

            <p class="p1_river3">** Paraibuna River **</p>
            <p class="p2_river3">Our river is considered one of the best in Brazil for practicing the sport, as it has a large volume 
                    of water and does not depend on rain to have a good level of rafting. 
                    It has class 2 and 3 rapids and allows the practice of the sport throughout the year.</p>

            <p class="p1_river4">** Paraibuna do Sul River **</p>
            <p class="p2_river4">This activity is a new Rafting route, on a very voluminous river that has great class 3 
                    and 4 rapids. It is ideal for people who have practiced the sport before and are 
                    looking for a more radical challenge. It is considered the strongest river in Brazil for 
                    the practice of Rafting.</p>
            
            <img class="img_river5" src="images/tocantinzinho_river.jpg" alt="TocantinzinhoRiver">
            <p class="p1_river5">** Tocantinzinho River **</p>
            <p class="p2_river5">Rafting on the Tocantinzinho River, in Chapada dos Veadeiros (GO), guarantees a view 
                    marked by clear waters and rock formations. During the dry season, from May to November, 
                    rafting passes through a canyon, a high point of activity in Chapada. 
                    In addition, there are options for itineraries on other rivers in the region. 
                    The cool thing is that there are options for all tastes, from two-hour journeys to 
                    multi-day expeditions.</p>
