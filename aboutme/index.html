        Hi dear colleagues! 
    </p>
    <p>
        Although my name is not a traditional Portuguese name, I was born and live in Brazil. 
        I'm 55 years old, married, and have a daughter who returned from her mission last December and an 18-year-old son.
    </p>
    <p>
        I graduated in Math many years ago and, since then, I've been working with software development, particularly SQL and Oracle.
        I'm not acquainted with web applications, reason why I'm taking this course (in addition to improving my ability with the English language).
        Currently, I help teams in the company I work for to create new features in our financial systems, adapt them to our customers' necessities or implement regulatory rules. 
    </p>
        I love to run, walk, bike, or practice other physical exercises. 
        I appreciate very much taking care of plants and flowers and to study about nutrition, medicine, and how our body works.
    <p>
        I'm sure it will be a great course with you to learn, share our experiences, and teach one another!!
    </p>
